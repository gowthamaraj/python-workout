> Strings in Python are the way we work with text. Words, sentences, paragraphs, and
even entire files are read into and manipulated via strings. Because so much of our
work revolves around text, it’s no surprise that strings are one of the most common
data types.

 -  You should remember two important things about Python strings: (1) they’re
immutable, and (2) in Python 3, they contain Unicode characters, encoded in
UTF-8.
