# Tuples and Lists
> Consider a program that has to work with documents, keep track of users, log the
IP addresses that have accessed a server, or store the names and birth dates of children in a school. In all of these cases, we’re storing many pieces of information.
We’ll want to display, search through, extend, and modify this information.
 These are such common tasks that every programming language supports collections, data structures designed for handling such cases. Lists and tuples are Python’s
built-in collections. Technically, they differ in that lists are mutable, whereas tuples
are immutable. But in practice, lists are meant to be used for sequences of the same
type, whereas tuples are meant for sequences of different types.
