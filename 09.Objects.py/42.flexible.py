 In this exercise, we’ll also implement a subclass of dict, which I call FlexibleDict.
Dict keys are Python objects, and as such are identified with a type. So if you use key 1
(an integer) to store a value, then you can’t use key '1' (a string) to retrieve that
value. But FlexibleDict will allow for this. If it doesn’t find the user’s key, it will try to
convert the key to both str and int before giving up; for example

class FlexibleDict(dict):
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        try:
            if key in self:
                pass
            elif str(key) in self:
                key = str(key)
            elif int(key) in self:
                key = int(key)
        except:
            pass
            
        return dict.__getitem__(self, key)
