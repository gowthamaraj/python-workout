# Objects

>  We’re now thinking at a higher level of abstraction and can better reason about
our code. Defining our own types also allows us to use shorthand when describing
concepts. Consider the difference between telling someone that you bought a “bookshelf” and describing “wooden boards held together with nails and screws, stored
upright and containing places for storing books.” The former is shorter, less ambiguous, and more semantically powerful than the latter.
 Another advantage is that if we decide to calculate the average in a new way—for
example, some teachers might drop the lowest score—then we can keep the existing
interface while modifying the underlying implementation
