"""
 In this exercise, write a generator function whose argument must be iterable. With
each iteration, the generator will return a two-element tuple. The first element in the
tuple will be an integer indicating how many seconds have passed since the previous
iteration. The tupleâ€™s second element will be the next item from the passed argument.
