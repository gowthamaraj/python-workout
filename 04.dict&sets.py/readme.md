# Dictionaries and Sets

> Dictionaries , or dicts, are one of Python’s most powerful and
important data structures. You may recognize them from other programming languages,
 in which they can be known as “hashes,” “associative arrays,” “hash maps,”
or “hash tables.”

## Dict Uses:
 - small databases, or records
 - For storing closely related names and values
 - accumulating information over time

## Sets
 -  Sets are extremely useful when you need to look something up in a large collection, such as
filenames, email addresses, or postal codes, because searching is O(1), just as in a dict.
