# Functional programming with comprehensions

> most developers would agree that short functions are a good idea, in no small part because they’re easier to understand, test, and maintain.

1.  Functional programming also assumes that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
2.  Python isn’t a functional language; we have mutable data types and assignment. But some functional techniques have made their way into the language and are
considered standard Pythonic ways to solve some problems.
