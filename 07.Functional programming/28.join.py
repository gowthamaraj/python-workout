"""
For this exercise, write a function (join_numbers) that takes a range of integers.
The function should return those numbers as a string, with commas between the
numbers. That is, given range(15) as input, the function should return this string:
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

def join_numbers(data):
    return ','.join([str(item) for item in data])


print(join_numbers(range(15)))
