"""
 In this exercise, we’re going to create a slight variation on map, one that applies
a function to each of the values of a dict. The result of invoking this function,
transform_values, is a new dict whose keys are the same as the input dict, but whose
values have been transformed by the function. (The name of the function comes from
Ruby on Rails, which provides a function of the same name.) The function passed to
transform_values should take a single argument, the dict’s value.
