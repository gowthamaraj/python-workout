# Files
> Files are an indispensable part of the world of computers, and thus of programming. We read data from files, and write to files. Even when something isn’t really a
file—such as a network connection—we try to use an interface similar to files because
they’re so familiar.
 To normal, everyday users, there are different types of files—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF, among others. To programmers, things are both simpler and more
complicated. They’re simpler in that we see files as data structures to which we can
write strings, and from which we can read strings. But files are also more complicated, in that when we read the string into memory, we might need to parse it into
